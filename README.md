## My process

My process was a Desktop first approach, utilizing a Flexbox to product the side-by-side layout.

This was the first project that allowed me to gain momentum on my own with little-to-no outside knowledge needed. The only outside research used was for the button transition as talked through below.  This was a huge confidence builder to be able to identify key structures when building a project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

My first interactive button with a smooth transition animation.

This was my first challenge with not only setting a transition time, but experimenting with how to transition back to it's original state. The biggest piece of knowledge gained is learning that a transition time can be set to the original state to allow a smooth transition back.


```css
.button:hover  i{
    opacity: 1;
    padding-left: 30px;
    transition: 500ms;
    transition-delay: 500ms;
    position: relative;
}
.button:hover{
    background-color: hsl(300, 69%, 71%);
    width: 90px;
    transition: width 1s;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
}
```

### Continued development

Positions within CSS. The Icon within the button gave issues during transition when returning to it's original state, the icon would appear below the text for a split second. I was able to add a delay to avoid this.

I am still having difficulty with the positions and how they correlate with each other, I end up cycling through them until I discover the one that works best.

This article helped explain the difficulty I was having with the button transition, and helped later when it came to the Social Icons.
